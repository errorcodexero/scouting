Goals

The overall goal is to write a scouting web application, accessible from smart
phones, tablets and such, to help the strategy team:
    - gather information about teams and robots.
    - gather information about matches and robot results.
    - in qulification, determine an appropriate strategy for the next match.
        how to best work with our alliance partners.
        how best to counter the opposing alliance.
        how to get all this information to the drive team when it's needed.
    - for elimination, strategize for alliance selection.

What follows is a start to get things moving, the details will be hammered out
during the build season.

Installation

Note that although these steps are detailed, they need to be followed with an
eye on figuring out what the mean, not just mechanically performing the steps.
Truth be told, it's a lot like getting a robot dev environment set up.  You
might have to do something several times before you know why you are doing it,
which is usually when you know what you're supposed to actually do.

1. Install Wamp: http://www.wampserver.com/en/
              Wampserver (64 bits & PHP 5.4) 2.4
"WampServer is a Windows web development environment. It allows you to
create web applications with Apache2, PHP and a MySQL database."

You can install Wamp in any directory, these instructures put it in
c:/Tools/wamp.  If you put it somewhere else, just adjust the paths.  

Also, if you are Mac or Linux inclined, this should all work just fine, if you
can figure out how to get your appropriate *AMP installtion going.

2. Change default port if desired
    If you've played with web stuff before you might already have something
    on port 80.  Change "Listen" in wamp/bin/apache/apache2.4.4/conf/httpd.conf, for example:

Listen 8080

3. Clone the scouting git repository from git:
    git clone https://code.google.com/p/fourteentwentyfive.scouting/

4. Start WampServer (there should be a shortcut on you desktop), the Wamp icon 
   in system tray should turn green.

5. In a browser, go to: http://localhost:<port>
    <port> is if you changed "Listen" from 80 above in step #2.
    You should see a very boring default web page for wamp.

6. Set up mysql
    a. Click "phpmyadmin" 
    b. enter Username "root", no password.
    c. click Go

phpMyAdmin is a mysql (database) admin tool. Once you log in, you should see an
interesting page with a lot going on.

7. Update your root password
  a. From the phpMyAdmin web page, click "SQL", copy/paste the following, then
     click "Go": 
         update mysql.user set password=PASSWORD("team1425rock$") where User='root';
  b. edit: c:/Tools/wamp/apps/phpMyAdmin-4.1.0/config.inc.php, change these two lines:
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = 'team1425rock$';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = false;

8. Set up your scouting database.
  a. in phpMyAdmin, click "Import"
  b. Under "File to Import", click "Browse" and find db/scouting.sql from your
     cloned git repository.


9. Connect the scouting app to Wamp:
   a. copy scouting.conf from your git clone to C:\Tools\wamp\alias.
   b. edit the paths to point to the "app" subdirectory of your git clone.
   c. restart Wamp (right-click "Exit" in system tray, restart).

10. Go to the scouting main page (don't worry that it's ugly, this is all 
    just getting started).
  a. In a browser, open http://localhost:<port>/scouting
    
11. Allow external connections
    a. Edit bin/apache/apache2.4.2/conf/httpd.conf, find the root www directory, like:
         <Directory "c:/tools/wamp/www/">
       "Require local" to "Require all granted"
