Goals

The overall goal is to write a scouting web application to help the strategy team:
    - gather information about teams and robots.
    - gather information about matches and robot results.
    - in qulification, determine an appropriate strategy for the next match.
        how to best work with our alliance partners.
        how best to counter the opposing alliance.
        how to get all this information to the drive team.
    - for elimination, strategize for alliance selection.

What follows is a start to get things moving, the details will need to be hammered out
during the build season.

Installation

Note that although these steps are detailed, they are meant to be followed 
with an eye on figuring out what the mean, not just mechanically performing the
steps.  Truth be told, it's a lot like getting a robot dev environment set up.
You might have to do something several times before you know why you're doing it, 
which is when you know what you're supposed to actually do.

1. Install Wamp: http://www.wampserver.com/en/
              Wampserver (64 bits & PHP 5.4) 2.4
"WampServer is a Windows web development environment. It allows you to
create web applications with Apache2, PHP and a MySQL database."

You can install Wamp anywhere, these instructures installed it in c:/Tools/wamp.
If you put it somewhere else, just appropriately adjust the paths.

2. Change default port if desired
    If you've played with web stuff before you might already have something
    on port 80.  Change in wamp/bin/apache/apache2.4.2/conf/httpd.conf

3. Clone the scouting git repository from git:
    git clone https://code.google.com/p/fourteentwentyfive.scouting/

4. Upgrade phpadmin, see below

6. Start WampServer (there should be an shortcut on you desctop), the Wamp icon 
   in system tray should turn green.

7. In a browser, go to: http://localhost:<port>
    <port> is if you changed it from 80 above in step #2.
    You should see a very boring default web page for wamp.

8. Click "phpmyadmin" 
    phpMyAdmin is a built-in mysql (database) admin tool. You should see an
    interesting page with a lot going on.

9. Set up your scouting database.
  a. On the left, click "New" to make a new database.
     In the form that pops up, enter "scouting" in the "Database name" field.
     click "Create"
  b. On the left, click "scouting"
  c. On the resulting view click "Import"
  d. Under "File to Import", click "Browse" and find db/scout-db.sql from your
     git repository.

10. Update your root password
  a. From the phpMyAdmin web page, click "SQL", copy/paste the following, then
     click the "Go" button: 
         update user set password=PASSWORD("team1425rock$") where User='root';
  b. edit: c:/Tools/wamp/apps/phpMyAdmin-4.1.0/config.inc.php, change these two lines:
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = 'team1425rock$';
$cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] = false;

11. Connect the scouting app to Wamp:
   a. copy scouting.conf from your git clone to C:\Tools\wamp\alias.
   b. edit the paths to point to the "app" subdirectory of your git clone.
   b. restart Wamp (right-click "Exit" in system tray, restart).

12. Go to the scouting main page (don't worry that it's ugly, this is all 
    just getting started).
  a. In a browser, open http://localhost:<port>/scouting
    

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade phpMyAdmin
    Go to: http://www.phpmyadmin.net/home_page/downloads.php
    Get phpMyAdmin-4.0.10-all-languages.zip
    Unzip to c:/Tools/wamp/apps/phpMyAdmin-4.1.0

Note: new releases appear often, pick a new one if you think it's better...

Now go to C:\Tools\wamp\alias. 
Copy phpmyadmin.conf from the scouting git clone to C:\Tools\wamp\alias.
The point is to get phpmyadmin.conf to reference 4.1.0, and to update the 
settings to allow allow you to connect phpMyAdmin from the "local" computer.

Alias /phpmyadmin "c:/Tools/wamp/apps/phpMyAdmin-4.1.0/" 

<Directory "c:/Tools/wamp/apps/phpMyAdmin-4.1.0/">
   Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
   AllowOverride all
   Require local
</Directory>
